## Motivation
Being an app developer, I am good at coding apps. But an app is quite different from a product. So the main purpose of this app is to create a side project and ship it like a product.

This exercise helped me get better at designing mobile app from scratch. There were times when I got stuck and the code just won't work as expected. After long hours of debugging, I overcame those challenges. Yasss! Such wins give me confidence and make me a better programmer.

Check out these Medium articles for more motivation.</br>

 - [The importance of side projects](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-importance-of-side-projects-cf9f63954031)

## Disclaimer
This is a side project app to experiment/play around with Android framework. This is not a production app. 
So there is no guarantee that issues/feature-requests/enhancements will be worked upon.
